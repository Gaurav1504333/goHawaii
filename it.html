                <h1>​International Travelers</h1>
                <p>The documents required for entering Hawaiʻi are different for citizens of countries 
                    outside of the United States. Here is a look at the documentation you will need, entry 
                    information specific to Canadian citizens and helpful information about Hawaiʻi’s 
                    currency.
                </p>
                <h2>Visa & Customs</h2>
                <p>
                    All international visitors, regardless of country of origin, must present a valid 
                    passport or secure document when entering the United States, including Hawaiʻi. 
                    Travel.State.gov is an excellent resource for in-depth information on types of visitor 
                    visas. For more specific information on entering U.S. borders, please review the U.S. 
                    Department of Homeland Security’s website.
                </p>
                <h2>Visa Waiver Program</h2>
                <p>The Visa Waiver Program enables nationals of 38 participating countries to travel to 
                    the United States for tourism or business (visitor [B] visa purposes only) for stays 
                    of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa. All travelers entering under this program 
                    are required to have a valid authorization through the Electronic System for Travel 
                    Authorization (ESTA) prior to travel.
                </p>
                <h2>Customs Information</h2>
                <p>While you are on the plane to Hawaiʻi, make sure you receive and complete the 
                    following forms. Each form must be completed on both sides in English, using black 
                    or blue ink.
                    <div class="tips">
                        <br>1. Customs Declaration Form. This form is required from all arriving passengers 
                        and crew, even if you have nothing to declare. One customs form may cover 
                        multiple persons as long as they are from the same household. Any type of dutiable 
                        good, food, plant or animal product must be declared. If you and your travel 
                        companions together are carrying $10,000 or more in cash or other negotiable 
                        instruments such as endorsed checks, you must declare it upon arrival. If you do not,
                        it is subject to forfeiture. Your money is not subject to taxation or duty.
                        <br>2. Immigration Form. An immigration form is required from all non-U.S. 
                        citizens with the exception of permanent U.S. residents and Canadian citizens.
                    </div>
                </p>
                <h2>Information for Canadian Citizens</h2>
                <p>
                    The most important formality on entering the United States is providing proof of your 
                    Canadian citizenship. Your Canadian passport is the best document for this, but review 
                    the complete list of documents and requirements below.
                </p>
                <p>By Air</p>
                <p>
                    When arriving in Hawaiʻi by air, all Canadian citizens (including children) are required
                    to produce a passport or NEXUS card, valid for the duration of their stay. Temporary 
                    passport holders may be subject to different entry requirements. Check with diplomatic 
                    representatives for up-to-date information. Official (special and diplomatic) passport 
                    holders must consult the Official Travel page, as they may be subject to different entry 
                    requirements.More detailed information is available on the Canada Border Services Agency 
                    (CBSA) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) websites.
                </p>
                <p>By Water (Cruise)</p>
                <p>
                    As per the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), Canadian citizens aged 16 and 
                    over must present one of the following documents when entering the U.S. by land or water:
                    <div class="tips">
                        <br>1. Passport
                        <br>2. NEXUS card
                        <br>3. Free and Secure Trade (FAST) card
                        <br>4. Enhanced driver’s license (EDL) or enhanced identification card (EIC) from a 
                        province or territory where a U.S.-approved EDL/EIC program has been implemented
                        <br>5. Secure Certificate of Indian Status
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WHTI-compliant document you choose to use must be valid for the duration of your 
                    stay in the United States. Canadian citizens aged 15 and under entering the U.S. by 
                    land or water require proof of citizenship, such as a passport, an original or a copy 
                    of a birth certificate or an original Canadian citizenship card. Canadian citizens aged 
                    18 and under who are traveling with a school or other organized group under adult 
                    supervision with written parental/guardian consent must also present proof of 
                    citizenship such as a birth certificate or passport. For more information, consult 
                    the CBP website.
                    <br>For additional information on utilizing a Secure Certificate of Indian Status as 
                    your entry identification, please visit Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) 
                    and Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. Canadians who are permanent residents of 
                    the U.S. must comply with special entry requirements. For more information, consult 
                    the CBP website.
                </p>
                <p>Visas</p>
                <p>
                    Canadian citizens generally do not require a visa to enter the United States 
                    directly from Canada for the purposes of visiting or studying.
                </p>
                <p>Length of Stay</p>
                <p>
                    Canadians, including “snowbirds” who winter in the U.S., are generally granted a stay 
                    for up to six months at the time of entry. The length of stay is determined at the 
                    port of entry by a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officer and is based on the purpose 
                    of travel at the time of initial entry. If you wish to stay longer you must apply for 
                    an extension with the nearest office of USCIS once you are in the U.S. and before the 
                    expiry of your initial authorized stay. You may be asked to demonstrate that you are 
                    only visiting the U.S. temporarily.
                </p>
                <p>Dual Citizenship</p>
                <p>Some Canadians may have U.S. as well as Canadian citizenship through birth in the U.S. 
                    or through naturalization or descent. Under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, 
                    citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport to enter or re-enter the U.S. 
                    by air. Although U.S. authorities do not formally require dual nationals to carry both 
                    a U.S. and a Canadian passport, carrying both documents as proof of citizenship may 
                    facilitate both entry into the U.S. and return to Canada. For more information, consult 
                    the Dual Citizenship section of the Travel.State.gov website of the U.S. Department of 
                    State, as well as the Laws and Culture tab.
                </p>
                <h2>Currency</h2>
                <p>
                    Hawaiʻi uses the United States Dollar as its currency. Exchanging money in Hawaiʻi is 
                    as simple as using an ATM (automated teller machine), however, it’s helpful to exchange 
                    some of your currency before you travel so you’ll have money for cab fare and other 
                    incidentals.
                    <br>Recently, U.S. currency has been reissued with new safety features, so there are 
                    many different varieties of bills and coins in circulation. U.S. paper bills come in $1, 
                    $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 denominations. Please note that some small stores and fast food 
                    outlets in Hawaiʻi will not accept bills over $20.
                    <br>U.S. coins include the penny (one cent), nickel (five cents), dime (10 cents) and 
                    quarter (25 cents). There are also $1 coins, but they are not used very often, and can 
                    be easily mistaken for quarters.
                </p>
                <h2>What Can I Take Home?</h2>
                <p>
                    Protecting ecosystems and agriculture goes two ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you return home, take a few minutes to check your country's return policies. 
                    Some of Hawaiʻi's plants, foods and products may not be accepted. We want you to have 
                    an enjoyable stay and be able take home your mementos.
