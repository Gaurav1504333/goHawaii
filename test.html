                            <p >The Hawaiian Islands itinerary that can change your life isn't 
                            found in any guidebooks. Because what makes the Hawaiian Islands 
                            truly special is not only our stunning natural beauty or our vibrant culture -
                            it's the deeply rooted relationship that connects them.</p>
                            <p >That relationship between people and place grows stronger every 
                            time you mālama (give back). When you give back - to the land, 
                            the ocean, the wildlife, the forest, the fishpond, the community - 
                            you're part of a virtuous circle that enriches everything and 
                            everyone. Including your experience as a visitor.</p>
                            <p >Several organizations offer opportunities for visitors to pay
                            it forward, like beach clean-ups, native tree planting, 
                            and more. Engage in some of our volunteer opportunities below, 
                            and in exchange, experiencfge Hawai'i on a much deeper and connected
                            level. Through the Mālama Hawai'i Program, you could qualify for a 
                            special discount or even a free night from a participating hotel when
                            participating in its dedicated volunteer activity.</p>

                            <p >The oldest of Hawaiian chants describe the Hawaiian Islands, 
                            the spirits that inhabit them, the forces of nature that shaped them 
                            and all the living things upon them as inextricably connected. This sense 
                            of connection is the foundation of Hawaiian culture: understanding that we 
                            all have a mandate to mālama, to care for our environment and for one another.</p>
                            <p >Today, Hawaiian culture may hold many of the answers sought in a rapidly 
                            changing world. The spirit of aloha – being in the presence of and sharing 
                            the essence of life – teaches us lessons of peace, kindness, compassion and 
                            responsibility to future generations. These lessons are expressed through chant, 
                            music, hula, arts and cultural practices, and through the warm, genuine greetings 
                            that are a hallmark of Hawaiian hospitality.</p>

                            <p >It's been said that a melting pot is not the most accurate way to describe 
                            Hawai'i's multiethnic population. It's more like a stew, where all the flavors 
                            complement and influence one another but the ingredients retain their richness and 
                            integrity instead of melting into an even sameness. Nothing tells the story of arrival, 
                            intermingling and reinvention of cultural traditions on the islands as deliciously as 
                            the variety of cuisines that make Hawai'i a foodie wonderland. It all starts with Hawai's 
                            first people, the Native Hawaiians.</p>
                            <p >Stewards of an island chain in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Native Hawaiians 
                            knew how to live sustainably. They partitioned segments of each island into ahupua'a 
                            (land divisions), where people were given the responsibility and privilege to manage 
                            the resources in their portion of the mountains, lowlands or ocean. The Hawaiians had a 
                            genius for engineering, constructing vast irrigation systems to supply water to terraced farms.</p>
